[build]
# Use the recommended command for CI/CD environments
command = "npm ci && npm run build"
# CRITICAL FIX: The correct publish directory for Next.js output 
# when using the Netlify plugin is simply .next.
publish = ".next"

# Specify a recent, stable Node.js version. 
environment = { NODE_VERSION = "20" }


[[plugins]]
# Essential plugin for Next.js features (ISR, dynamic routing, etc.)
package = "@netlify/plugin-nextjs"

# 💥 FIX APPLIED HERE: The [build] section that followed must be 
# on a completely new line below the plugin configuration.

[build] # This line must be on its own line, not immediately after the package name.
# ... (and then the rest of your original [build] settings if you intended to duplicate them)
